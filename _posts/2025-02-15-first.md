~_Credits to Ed.R on youtube_~

I intend this to be a ongoing draft of a bike power meter i will be developing based off internet/youtube resources and a basic knowledge of basic electronics. The end goal of this, I hope, would be a fully fledged guide that a layman can pick up and complete with ease.

Based off the videos that I've seen the cheapest and the most successful one looks to be Ed.r's powermeter that I can source parts for less then S$30 through websites like Aliexpress and Taobao.

The initial setup looks very simple consisting of

1.  HX711 - A very common load cell amplifier
    
2.  An Arduino
    
3.  Strain Gauges
    
4.  Miscellaneous stuff like wires, usb cables.
