~_Credits to Ed.R on youtube_~

I intend this to be a ongoing draft of a bike power meter i will be developing based off internet/youtube resources and a basic knowledge of basic electronics. The end goal of this, I hope, would be a fully fledged guide that a layman can pick up and complete with ease.

Based off the videos that I've seen the cheapest and the most successful one looks to be Ed.r's powermeter that I can source parts for less then S$30 through websites like Aliexpress and Taobao.

The initial setup looks very simple and promising consisting of

1.  HX711 - A very common load cell amplifier
    
2.  An Arduino
    
3.  Strain Gauges
    
4.  Miscellaneous stuff like wires, usb cables.
    

Prototype 1:

I made this out of a wrench I picked up off a hardware store and a commonly available HX711 breakput board for weighing scale applications.

For anyone using this breakout Pins X1 and Rate and connected you'd need to sever the copper track on the back of the board, and short Pins rate and VCC to acheive 80 samples per second (sps) as mention on the datasheet.

This is the code I used to test the output, after connecting according to schematic.

```javascript
import serial
import time
import threading
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation

# Function to read serial data
def read_serial_data(serial_port='/dev/tty.usbmodem144201', baud_rate=115200, timeout=1):
    # Set up the serial connection
    ser = serial.Serial(serial_port, baud_rate, timeout=timeout)
    time.sleep(2)  # Give some time for the connection to initialize
    ser.flushInput()  # Flush any stale data

    try:
        while True:
            line_data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
            if line_data:
                print(f"Received data: {line_data}") 
                data_queue.append(line_data)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Stopping serial read.")
    finally:
        ser.close()



# Set up the plot using Matplotlib
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x_data, y_data = [], []
line, = ax.plot([], [], '-r')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Raw Value')
plt.title('Live Data from HX711')
plt.ylim(-150, 150)  # Set y-axis limit to accommodate expected values

start_time = time.time()
data_queue = []  # Shared data queue for serial data

# Update function for animation
def update(frame):
    global x_data, y_data
    while data_queue:
        line_data = data_queue.pop(0)
        try:
            raw_value = float(line_data)
            current_time = time.time() - start_time
            x_data.append(current_time)
            y_data.append(raw_value)

            # Limit the view to the latest 50 data points
            x_data_trimmed = x_data[-50:]
            y_data_trimmed = y_data[-50:]
            line.set_data(x_data_trimmed, y_data_trimmed)
            ax.relim()
            ax.autoscale_view()
        except ValueError:
            continue
    return line,

# Start the serial reading in a separate thread
serial_thread = threading.Thread(target=read_serial_data, daemon=True)
serial_thread.start()

# Set up the animation
ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, blit=True, interval=50)
plt.show()
```
