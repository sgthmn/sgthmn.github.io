~_Credits to Ed.R on youtube_~

I intend this to be a ongoing draft of a bike power meter i will be developing based off internet/youtube resources and a basic knowledge of basic electronics. The end goal of this, I hope, would be a fully fledged guide that a layman can pick up and complete with ease.

Based off the videos that I've seen the cheapest and the most successful one looks to be Ed.r's powermeter that I can source parts for less then S$30 through websites like Aliexpress and Taobao.

The initial setup looks very simple and promising consisting of

1.  HX711 - A very common load cell amplifier
    
2.  An Arduino
    
3.  Strain Gauges
    
4.  Miscellaneous stuff like wires, usb cables.
    

Prototype 1:

I made this out of a wrench I picked up off a hardware store and a commonly available HX711 breakout board for weighing scale applications.

For anyone using this breakout Pins X1 and Rate and connected you'd need to sever the copper track on the back of the board, and short Pins rate and VCC to acheive 80 samples per second (sps) as mentioned on the datasheet.

**Arduino code**

I used an arduino nano ble 33. Configure pins and baud rate according to your MCU. Delay set to 12.5ms for readings to be 80sps as expected from data sheet. At this stage unable to confirm whether accurate.

```javascript
#include "HX711.h"

const int DOUT_PIN = A4;  // Data output pin
const int SCK_PIN = A5;   // Serial clock pin

HX711 scale;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); 


  scale.begin(DOUT_PIN, SCK_PIN);
  scale.set_scale();  

  scale.tare();
}

void loop() {

  long rawValue = scale.read();
  

  Serial.println(rawValue);


  delay(12.5);
}
```

This is the code I used to test the output, after connecting according to schematic. baud\_rate and serial\_port have to be manually input based on the device you are using.

**Graph code**

```javascript
import serial
import time
import threading
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation

def read_serial_data(serial_port='/dev/tty.usbmodem144201', baud_rate=115200, timeout=1):
    # Set up the serial connection
    ser = serial.Serial(serial_port, baud_rate, timeout=timeout)
    time.sleep(2) 
    ser.flushInput()  

    try:
        while True:
            line_data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
            if line_data:
                print(f"Received data: {line_data}") 
                data_queue.append(line_data)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Stopping serial read.")
    finally:
        ser.close()


fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x_data, y_data = [], []
line, = ax.plot([], [], '-r')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Raw Value')
plt.title('Live Data from HX711')
plt.ylim(-150, 150)  

start_time = time.time()
data_queue = []  


def update(frame):
    global x_data, y_data
    while data_queue:
        line_data = data_queue.pop(0)
        try:
            raw_value = float(line_data)
            current_time = time.time() - start_time
            x_data.append(current_time)
            y_data.append(raw_value)

            # Limit the view to the latest 50 data points
            x_data_trimmed = x_data[-50:]
            y_data_trimmed = y_data[-50:]
            line.set_data(x_data_trimmed, y_data_trimmed)
            ax.relim()
            ax.autoscale_view()
        except ValueError:
            continue
    return line,


serial_thread = threading.Thread(target=read_serial_data, daemon=True)
serial_thread.start()


ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, blit=True, interval=50)
plt.show()
```
